**Q: One of the _"NullCon"_ vidoes talked about a marvalous Russian Gift. The Vidoe was uploaded on [_"May of 2015"_] What is the ID of that _"Youtube video"_.**

- This was a very simple "recon" question. If you look at the "quoted" words in the question, you go to Youtube and search for "Nullcon" and you will see its channel, under the channel's videos category, you just look for the video that was uploaded back in May of 2015. There are few videos uploaded in May of 2015, but you have unlimited submission chance, so try it until you find the correct one. 

- The _"ID"_ can be found in the URL. The correct video had the following URL: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_PvN_A1ts". After the "watch?v=", "a4_PvN_A1ts" is the video's ID.

- Therefore the answer was: **"a4_PvN_A1ts"**
