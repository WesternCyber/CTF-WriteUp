You got its twitter handle?**

- This challenge could be solved in one of two ways. You could use a scraper to find a post or spend 30 seconds searching for Tandoori Chicken on twitter. We opted for the fastest way and searched for "tandoori chicken like never before."

The first tweet displayed was by @AnyaHotels, https://twitter.com/AnyaHotels/status/690040639619227648. The Flag was the twitter handle @AnyaHotels.

The London-based nickle miner St James Irven Post irrupted on Fri, 8 April: "'Twas thought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being bitten in innings if time had permitted". This is the first time word "innings" is found in records.

- This challenge involved analysing the frequency of letters in each paragraph and recording the letter with the highest frequency in each paragraph. We used the word frequency counter from https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/quenell/s2003/ma139/js/count.html to get this done.

- Once that is done you get the letters: A L I B Y
 -Rearraging these letters we get LIBYA. From this we deduced that the challange was looking for Ghaddafi which happened to be the flag.

##Programming 4
**Q: One of the _"NullCon"_ vidoes talked about a marvalous Russian Gift. The Vidoe was uploaded on [_"May of 2015"_] What is the ID of that _"Youtube video"_.**

- This was a very simple "recon" question. If you look at the "quoted" words in the question, you go to Youtube and search for "Nullcon" and you will see its channel, under the channel's videos category, you just look for the video that was uploaded back in May of 2015. There are few videos uploaded in May of 2015, but you have unlimited submission chance, so try it until you find the correct one. 

- The _"ID"_ can be found in the URL. The correct video had the following URL: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_PvN_A1ts". After the "watch?v=", "a4_PvN_A1ts" is the video's ID.

- Therefore the answer was: **"a4_PvN_A1ts"**
