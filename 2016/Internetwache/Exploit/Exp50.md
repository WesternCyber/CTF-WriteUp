## Write-up

### Part Zero
We were given a service which we connect using python sockets.

```
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('188.166.133.53',12037))
data = s.recv(1024)
print data
```

And we get the first part
```
Let me count the ascii values of 10 characters:
```

They are asking for 10 ascii characters that has a sum of larger than 1020, but also fits the regex:
*/^[a-f]{10}$/*
